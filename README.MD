# Ursula UI Learning Path

This repository will help us track the assignments with questions work and answers.

> NOTE: We will be using Tailwind CSS CDN

We will will be using the following format to name the assignemnts

`v[number]/quiz` - This will be the question to be addressed by student

`v[number]/attempt` - This will be the results of student's attempt

`v[number]/answer` - This will be the answer provided by the trainer

On the `v[number]/quiz` branch, a photo of the design should be added and instructions provided on the branch's `readme.md` file.

# Ursula UI Learning Path

This repository will help us track the assignments with questions, attempts and answers.

> NOTE: We will be using Tailwind CSS CDN

We will be using the following format to name the assignments.

`v[number]/quiz` - This will be the question to be addressed by the student

`v[number]/attempt` - This will be the results of the student's attempt

`v[number]/answer` - This will be the answer provided by the trainer

On the `v[number]/quiz` branch, a photo of the design should be added, and instructions should be provided on the branch's `readme.md` file.
